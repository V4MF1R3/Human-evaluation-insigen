            <h2>Finding insights from textual dimensions</h2>
            <p>Insigen is an advanced natural language processing (NLP) model designed to unravel the diverse thematic
                layers within textual data. Its primary objective is to discern the distribution of generalized topics
                within a text corpus, providing a nuanced understanding of the multifaceted themes covered in articles
                or documents. By identifying the overarching topics to which an article belongs, Insigen offers valuable
                insights into the intricate tapestry of content, allowing for more informed analysis andÂ exploration.
